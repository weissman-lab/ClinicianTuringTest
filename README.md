This repository contains supplementary study materials related to the AVA Clinician Turing Test.

**Included in this repository:**

- `AVA_CTT_Informed_Consent.pdf`: this pdf contains the informed consent form that will be used with participants in the Turing Test.
  
- `turing_test_power_glmer.r`: this R script contains the power calculations for the primary analysis of our Turing test based on a mixed-effects logistic regression model with an equivalence design, accounting for crossed random effects for both vignette and participant.

- `turing_test_power_classifier.jl`: this Julia script contains the power calculations for the secondary analysis of our Turing Test using a binary classifier framework.

**Next steps:**

Once available, a summary of survey responses at the vignette level will be added to this repository.
